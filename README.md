# Classic
 [Classic](https://emmabergner.github.io/blink/) is a Python terminal game, and inspired version of the classic game "hangman" but with a twist. 
 
 Classic can be used for playing and fun purposes but also as an application looking for lunch or dinner ideas. With a simple design and it's own twist. The idea is for users to have fun playing but also to get some inspiration for next coming meal of the day.
 
 The terminal ask the user what the meal of the day is and prevents it by the end of the game. 

## How to play
Like the classic hangman game, the player guesses on a letter that could be apart of the chosen word, is told how long the word is and has a certain tries of guesses. In this version I have a specific theme on the words, which is different meals. 

 - The user starts by enter first guess of letter. 

- The given letter will be printed by the terminal as a correct answer or wrong answer. 

- The user wins by entering the right letters before 8 turns. 

## Features

### Existing Features
Welcome message 
- The game starts by displaying a welcome and introduction message to the user. 

User input
- The user is asked to type in a letter that could match the word. 

Input validation 
- Users will get an error message if numbers or already give letter is being entered.

Decision 
- If the letter matches any letter in the word, it will appear on the correct spot in the word. And if the letter does not match it will be displayed in a different list. 
- Guesses are displayed and updated after each round
- Repeats 8 times unless user guess word before. 

### Future features 
- I would like to add larger scale of words for the users.
- Give users more options and choices. 
- Allow users to choice different categories.
